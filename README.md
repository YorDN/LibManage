## ‚ùì About
**LibManage** is a library management tool, based on the web. It is build using ASP.NET Core MVC with .NET 8 for the perpose of being final project for the SoftUni's ASP.NET Advanced course! It utilises key OOP concepts following the *Model-View-Controller* pattern. You can access the full website from [here](http://batedan4o-001-site1.jtempurl.com/) (I am sorry it is not https, have no money üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

As mentioned **LibManage** uses ASP.NET Core MVC with .NET 8. For the database it uses SQL Server (MsSql) 2022. Authorization and authentication are done via the Microsoft.Identity systen. The frontend is mostly done with Bootstrap. On the admin pages, it utilizes the chart.js framework for displaying useful information to the admin. 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
Every person who wants to work on the website should have these technologies (and tools) installed:
- .NET 8 or higher
- SQL Server 2022 or newer
- ASP.NET Core Enviorment
- IDE, supporting the .NET Framework (Prefferably Microsoft Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider)

## üü¢ Installation
LibManage doesn't require installation to work. You can visit the website from [here](http://batedan4o-001-site1.jtempurl.com/). 

But if you wish to install it, the installation process is straightforward. First you have to clone the repository in your desired IDE (or as a matter of fact in your file system). From there you have to make a database and connect it via connection string in either the appsettings.json or user secrets (Refer to the [technologies](#%EF%B8%8F-technologies) section for requirements regarding technology). \

The connection string should be in the following format
``` bash
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_db;User Id=...;Password=...;"
}
```
or if you have a different setup, refer to [this](https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/) website 

From then you only have to start the application. The DbSeeder class will handle the migration/seeding of the database. 

### üìÉ Seeded data

Upon successful startup the database will fill with the following data:
- **3 authors** üë§ \
  Including *Dimitar Talev*, *Stephen King* and *Ivan Vazov*. Pioneers of both bulgarian and world literature and poetry.
- **2 publishers** üë§ \
  Including *Zahari Stoyanov* and *Pleiad*
- **3 books** üìö \
  Including "The Iron Candlestick" (–ñ–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏–ª–Ω–∏–∫), "The Volunteers at Shipka" (–û–ø—ä–ª—á–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –®–∏–ø–∫–∞) and "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger" (–¢—ä–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∫—É–ª–∞ 1: –°—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ü—ä—Ç). Each of them representing the *three different types of books* available in the library: physical, digital and audio. Please refer to the [features](#-features) section for more information.
