## ‚ùì About
**LibManage** is a library management tool, based on the web. It is build using ASP.NET Core MVC with .NET 8 for the perpose of being final project for the SoftUni's ASP.NET Advanced course! It utilises key OOP concepts following the *Model-View-Controller* pattern. You can access the full website from [here](http://batedan4o-001-site1.jtempurl.com/) (I am sorry it is not https, have no money üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è)

## üü¢ Installation
LibManage doesn't require installation to work. You can visit the website from [here](http://batedan4o-001-site1.jtempurl.com/). 

But if you wish to install it, the installation process is straightforward. First you have to clone the repository in your desired IDE (or as a matter of fact in your file system). From there you have to make a database and connect it via connection string in either the appsettings.json or user secrets (Refer to the [technologies](#-technology) section for requirements regarding technology). \

The connection string should be in the following format
``` bash
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_db;User Id=...;Password=...;"
}
```
or if you have different setup, refer to [this](https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/) website 

From then you only have to start the application. The DbSeeder class will handle the migration/seeding of the database. 

### üìÉ Seeded data

Upon successful startup the database will fill with the following data:
- **3 authors** üë§ \
  Including *Dimitar Talev*, *Stephen King* and *Ivan Vazov*. Pioneers of both bulgarian and world literature and poetry.
- **2 publishers** üë§ \
  Including *Zahari Stoyanov* and *Pleiad*
- **3 books** üìö \
